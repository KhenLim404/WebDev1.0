    <p> <br>Hello ma,</br></br> 
        
        Thank you for everything that you do for me. There are no words that can truly capture the depth of my gratitude. From the very beginning, you’ve made countless sacrifices, things I’ll never fully understand but you did it all to make sure I had the best possible life. You've always been there for me, offering love and support, even when times were tough.
        
        I want to thank you for all the little and big things: the sleepless nights, the meals you made with love, the hugs that made everything better, and the lessons you’ve taught me that will stay with me forever. You worked hard, often putting your own needs aside, just to ensure that me and my sisters were well taken care of. Your dedication has shaped me into who I am today, and I can never thank you enough for that.
        
        I appreciate every sacrifice, every moment, and all the love you’ve given. You are not only my mother, but my biggest supporter, my role model, and the heart of our family. I may not always show it or say it enough, but I am beyond thankful. Your strength and selflessness are inspiring, and I will always carry that with me.
        
        I love you more than words can express, Ma. You mean the world to me. Thank you for everything. </p>
